These are the software packages that I have found to be useful.  I
list them here because I can never remember the infrequently used
ones.

Binary(hex) editor - tweak
    tweak is an efficient hex editor.  tweak possesses a fully
    functional insert mode.  By default, tweak loads the input file
    lazily instead of loading the entire input file into memory.
    Opening a large file is instantaneous, making modifications causes
    tweak's memory usage to grow with the size of the changes rather
    than the size of the whole file, and only when saving the altered
    version will tweak have to read through the entire input file to
    write the output.
